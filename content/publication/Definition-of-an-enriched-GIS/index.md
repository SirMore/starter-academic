abstract: 
'Among the most serious natural disasters, earthquakes cause severe damages to infrastructures and building,can  kill  or  injure  thousands  of  humans  and  animals  and,  in  the  luckiest  circumstances,  just  make  peoplehomeless destroying communities, habitats, economies and mental equilibrium. In order to minimise the lossof lives, an effective evacuation plan to cope with worldwide disasters is required.  In this paper we describea novel approach to timely formulate an evacuation plan of an area struck by an earthquake.  The proposedsolution leverages on a two-steps modeling framework: i) a method that extracts from enriched GIS data anetwork description of the area to be evacuated; ii) a dynamic optimization model that calculates the safestpaths citizens should follow to reach pre-identified safe areas.   While the network is computed off-line atdesign time, the optimization model, or one of its reductions, can be embedded in a real-time system that,recomputing it several times, can guide citizen after a natural disaster even in case of high dynamic scenario.Our approach is demonstrated on a real study case:  the medieval center of the Italian town of Sulmona, forwhich detailed GIS data with information on the urban structure and building vulnerability are available.'
