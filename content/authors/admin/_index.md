Evans Etrue Howard is a PhD Candidate in  Information and Communication Technology at University of L'Aquila.  His focuses on modeling and solving large-scale optimization problems. In the optimization domain specific research areas are Integer Programming, Network Optimization, Combinatorial Optimization and Scheduling. 

His activities mainly concentrate on methods for finding provably good solutions (exact or heuristics) to emergengency evaacuation planning either pre- or post- disasters. Techniques been developed are applied to real life application of pedestrain evacuation.
